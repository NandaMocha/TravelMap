## Overview

TravelMap is a project developed as part of the SwiftUI Bootcamp by [Swiftful Thinking](https://www.swiftfulthinking.com/). This iOS application leverages SwiftUI and MapKit to create an interactive travel mapping experience, built with the MVVM architecture and utilizing the Observable Macro introduced in iOS 17+.

## Features

- Interactive map interface powered by MapKit
- MVVM architecture for clean and maintainable code
- Utilizes SwiftUI for a modern, declarative UI
- Leverages the Observable Macro for efficient state management
- Supports iOS 17 and above

## Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface
- **MapKit**: For map functionality and location-based features
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel architecture
- **Observable Macro**: For reactive state management
- **iOS 17+**: Targeting the latest iOS features
- **Xcode 15+**: Development environment

## Getting Started
